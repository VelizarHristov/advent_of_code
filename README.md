Solving Advent of Code problems across multiple years in Scala.

Some of my solutions are in other repositories:
- [Complete 2023 in C#](https://github.com/VelizarHristov/AdventOfCode2023)
- [Some of 2022 in Kotlin](https://github.com/VelizarHristov/advent_of_code_2022)
- [Some of 2019 in Rust and some in OCaml](https://github.com/VelizarHristov/advent_of_code_2019)

After 2023, I realized that AoC is difficult enough on its own that it is unnecessary to mix it with language experiments, it merely starts easy.
